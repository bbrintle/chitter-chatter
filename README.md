## Description

Welcome to Chitter Chatter, a morale booster/community builder app! This application currently allows authenticated users to add other registered users as contacts, create chatrooms with contacts, and chat with those contacts. Users also have the ability to post ‘recognition’ shout-outs to other members to support a positive community atmosphere. Our team strives to expand upon this functionality to allow an organization/company to create a self-contained community to limit users to the broader team, customize ‘spotlight’ components to show organization-specific goals and messages, and provide customizable themes and tools (including but not limited to a functional dark mode).
